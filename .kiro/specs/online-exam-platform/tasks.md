# Implementation Plan

Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Advanced Online Exam Platform development into manageable, incremental coding tasks. Each task builds upon previous ones, following test-driven development practices and ensuring early validation of core functionality. Backend API will be built and tested first with Postman before creating UI components.
